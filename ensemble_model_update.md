# Ensemble Model Integration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated app.py**:
   - Modified the model loading system to load the ensemble model components (LSTM feature extractor, classifiers, and full ensemble model) instead of the original LSTM model
   - Changed variable names to reflect the new model architecture
   - Made the model loading process more robust with better error handling
   - Updated paths to point to the models in the `/models/ensemble_sentiment_model/` directory
   - Improved the prediction function to handle both the full ensemble model and individual classifiers

2. **Created Test Notebook**:
   - Added a Jupyter notebook (`ensemble_model_test.ipynb`) to demonstrate and test the ensemble model
   - Included code to validate that the model components load correctly
   - Added a function to test the API endpoint after the app is running

## Model Architecture

The new ensemble model architecture consists of:
1. **LSTM Feature Extractor**: `lstm_feature_extractor.h5` - Extracts features from text for classification
2. **Traditional ML Classifiers**:
   - Random Forest: `best_classifier_random_forest.pkl`
   - Gradient Boosting: `best_classifier_gradient_boosting.pkl`
   - Logistic Regression: `best_classifier_lojistik_regresyon.pkl`
3. **Full Ensemble Model**: `full_ensemble_model.h5` (Optional)
4. **Tokenizer**: `tokenizer.pkl` - For preprocessing text
5. **Configuration**: `config.json` - Contains model parameters

## Usage

The application now follows this process:
1. Load the ensemble model and its components
2. For prediction:
   - Preprocess and tokenize the text
   - Extract LSTM features
   - If the full ensemble model is available, use it for prediction
   - Otherwise, use the best classifier according to the config

## Testing

To test the changes:
1. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
2. Open and run the test notebook: `ensemble_model_test.ipynb`
3. Uncomment and run the API testing code in the last cell of the notebook after confirming the server is running

## Fallback

The application still includes the dictionary-based sentiment analysis as a fallback method if there are any issues loading or using the ensemble model.
